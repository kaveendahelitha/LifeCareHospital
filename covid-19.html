            <h3>COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) Also called: Coronavirus, COVID-19</h3>
            <p class="p">COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) is an illness caused by a virus. This virus is a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special
                treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease,or cancer are more likely to
                develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age.</p>


            <p class="p">The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is important to practice
                respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.</p>

            <p class="p">As a hospital committed to upholding the highest international standards, we have taken strict protective measures against COVID-19. Our dedicated team is working around the clock to continuously offer essential healthcare services during
                the coronavirus pandemic and protect you from COVID-19 infection within hospital premises.</p>

                <h2>PCR tests</h2>
                <h3> What is a PCR test?</h3>

                PCR stands for Polymerase Chain Reaction. It is a very sensitive method to determine small amounts of virus or any other infectious agent in a sample. The genetic material of the agent is amplified many times to make it easily detectable. The PCR test
                for COVID-19 infection detects RNA (genetic material) of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes COVID-19 infection.


                <h3>How to get a PCR test for COVID-19?</h3>

                The virus infects the nose and throat in initial stages. Therefore, swabs are collected from the nose and throat. These swabs are sent to the laboratory in a special medium. The laboratory will perform a Real Time PCR Assay to find out whether the COVID-19
                virus gene is present in the sample. The presence of the gene indicates that the person is infected with COVID-19. The laboratory will issue the test result within 24 hours.


                <h3>Compulsory information/documents to be provided by the patient</h3>

                This depends on the purpose of test. No documentation is needed if the test is done due to existing symptoms.

                <h3>How can I get my test results after a PCR test?</h3>

                You will receive a SMS on your mobile from the laboratory with the instructions to download the report from our website. You can also request the report to be emailed or sent via WhatsApp.

                <h2>RAT Tests</h2>
                <h3>What is a Rapid Antigen Test?</h3>

                The Rapid Antigen Test is performed to determine whether the COVID-19 virus is present in the nose/throat of a patient with symptoms. This test gives a result in 15 minutes. The Rapid Antigen Test is performed by the laboratory, based on a doctor’s prescription.


                <h3>Compulsory information/documents to be provided by the patient</h3>

                Only the doctor’s prescription is required.


                <h3>How can I get my test results after the rapid antigen test?</h3>

                A written report will be issued to you immediately after the test is completed. You can request for a printed report later if it is required.
