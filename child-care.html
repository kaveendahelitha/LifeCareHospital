         <p>This can be a very stressful and scary time for you and your child when they need to have a procedure in the hospital.
          <br>   
          We are ready to help children and parents prepare for the hospital and answer some of their questions.

                    The disease can be devastating to anyone, but it seems especially unfair when they hit children.
                 Because researchers have made great strides in controlling many childhood diseases, they are not all darkness and destruction.
               Going to the hospital is a time of anxiety for children and their parents

                 Try to go to the ward with your child before entering.
                 It also creates an important moral, social and economic need to ensure that all children are as healthy as possible. Healthy children are more likely to be healthy adults

                 According to adult standards, children are generally considered to be healthy and have made great strides in reducing child mortality and morbidity. 
                 Recent improvements in child health need to be sustained and further efforts are needed to optimize it. To achieve this, the nation must have an improved understanding of health factors and effective strategies for measuring and using information on child health

                    <p>
                       Cancer signs and symptoms can be very similar to those of other childhood illnesses.
                       <br>It is important to go to your doctor if you're worried.
                           Having cancer brings many changes to a child’s life.<br>
                           You can help your child by keeping her life as normal as possible.
                         Pediatric cancer is rare, with 1 in every 600 children getting cancer before the age of 15

                 Pneumonia is the leading cause of death among children under the age of 5, <br>
                 with about 800,000 children dying each year. <br>
                 In many parts of the world, a child dies of pneumonia every 39 seconds.

                     Ear pain is more common in children and can have many causes,<br>
                     including ear infections (otitis media), swimming ear (skin infection in the ear canal),<br>

                      If you have a high fever, both ears are involved, or your child has other symptoms,
                      <br> your pediatrician may decide that antibiotics are the best treatment.
